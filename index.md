Hello there, Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Ingenia Health](https://ingeniahealth.com/). I'm interested in film and photography, along with minimalism and mid-century architecture.

You can find me on [Threads](https://threads.net/@georgeperez) and [Mastodon](https://c.im/@georgeperez/) for text updates, [Glass](https://glass.photo/george) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/georgeperez/) photography, [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/georgeperez/) for my film diary, and finally on [GitHub](https://github.com/georgeperez/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgeperezmarrero/) for my hobby/professional work.
