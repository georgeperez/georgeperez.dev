<strong>Colophon</strong>

This website is something that I use to test out different whims I have from time to time. My first solo project was adapating different things to my liking from other people, and this website is no exception. It's still built with Jekyll, and is hosted with Cloudflare Pages.

I'll probably only read post things about politics and tech here. Some photographs every now and then as well.

This website is based on the [digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt.


This website uses [Flexoki by Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/flexoki) to add a dark scheme to Maxime's template.
