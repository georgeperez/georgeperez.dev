**Colophon**

This website is something I use to test out different things from time to time. It's been built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) since the beginning, save a few never-deployed migration attempts to Eleventy. It's been hosted on various providers over the years but right now it's on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The entire set up costs me an eye-watering $0 a year. This website uses:

- [digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
- [uchÅ«](https://uchu.style/)
