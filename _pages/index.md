<strong>Colophon</strong>

Hey, I'm a software engineer, photographer, cinephile, minimalist, and a fan of Formula 1 (Papaya).

Currently working on data warehousing solutions in healthcare management.

This website is something I use to test out different things from time to time. It's been built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) since the beginning, save a few never-deployed migration attempts to Eleventy. It's been hosted on various providers over the years but right now it's on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). The entire set up costs me an eye-watering $0 a year.

This website is based on the [digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt.

This website uses [uchū](https://uchu.style/) for the color palette.
