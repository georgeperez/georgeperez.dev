On 11 March, Jeffrey Goldberg, ex-IOF[^1] soldier and Editor-in-Chief of _The Atlantic_, [was mistakenly added](https://archive.md/JIxF8) to a Signal group chat by National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Goldberg shared the space with various senior US government officials where they discussed the attack plans of the US-led bombing of Yemen on 15 March, [killing 61 people, including 2 children, and wounding 98 people in total](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/16/houthis-vow-response-as-us-says-unrelenting-strikes-to-continue-in-yemen). All the while, no one from the Trump administration knew Goldberg eavesdropped on their messages. 

Since the initial attack, [the US has kept bombing Yemen for three straight weeks, every single day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March–April_2025_United_States_attacks_in_Yemen#Strikes), including the day I’m publishing this. The bombing campaign has claimed the lives of over a hundred martyrs.

> I’m not going to list out all the details of the original story here. You should read it to get all the details, as I will be plucking out things from the group chat conversation piecemeal.

US media is covering this scandal as a failure of national security from the Trump administration and I agree that this was a failure in basic security practices. I agree that using the ephemeral features Signal has to evade record-keeping requirements is not correct. However, I don’t think I care as much about these things as the US media and Usonians[^2] fear.

The responses I have seen about this “scandal” have around the “but her emails!” gotcha referring to Trump’s obsession back in 2016 with Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as US Secretary of State. In a normal world, I’m all for calling out hypocrisy (I do believe in accountability, after all) but what is pointing out the inherent hypocrisy the first Trump administration has already shown going to do about the fact that he is in power? That the US is bombing Yemen? That the US is arming “Israel” to murder Palestinians until every single one is gone? Or that Puerto Rico is a US colony with no rights?

Goldberg was in the group chat for four days before the US bombed Yemen. From his own account, when the first bombs dropped at 2 PM Eastern Time, Goldberg was aware of it since 11:44 AM. That’s 2 hours and 16 minutes and four days where Goldberg knew the US was planning to bomb Yemen and yet he did… nothing. He did not come forward with the information to warn the public. 

He let the United States murder 61 people because it suits his personal beliefs. After all, Goldberg served in the IOF during the First Intifada. The entire reason the US is bombing Yemen again is because the Houthis are supportive of Palestinians fight for resistance in occupied Palestine. Yemen has been in a bloody civil war for over a decade at this point from Saudi-led intervention with weapons the US has sold them.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve been taught that the United States protects the world from the “bad guys”. The reason it needs to have military bases in over 100 different countries is because it needs to deter the “bad guys” from attacking the US and its allies in NATO. I’ve been taught the United States does not negotiate with terrorists. It upholds international law. It upholds human rights. It upholds democracy.

I haven’t felt that these have been true for a while, if I ever did. For the longest time, I had doubts about the reasons for the US having military bases in random countries around the world. It has historically had over a dozen bases in Puerto Rico alone and I haven’t felt anything good about them. Vieques was bombed for over 50 years until Boricuas expelled the Navy from the lands in the early 2000s, with the closure of the Vieques base in 2003. Stemming from the incessant bombing of Vieques it has caused the residents of the island to have 20 times higher cancer incidences than the main island of Puerto Rico.

Do not look at the genocide of Palestinians carried out by “Israel” and funded by the US [that will claim at least 186,000 martyrs in the Gaza Strip](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01169-3/fulltext). Don't look at what their greatest ally is doing in the West Bank. Don’t look at what the US is doing in Yemen, either.

The US has a term for when _they_ do assassinations: *targeted killings*. A noxious euphemism to describe murdering people in a given area of their drone strike. It’s the moral and indiscriminate way to assassinate someone. Whatever that means.


I'm tired. I’m not 100% concerned about the fact these idiots  shared classified information inside a Signal group chat. Signalgate is a distraction from the fact that the US is funding genocide and bombing foreign countries with whom they are not at war with. Say what you will about international law, but in order to commit to war you need approval from the local government to do so. The United States has not done that.

Ever since the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the US has decided it will bomb anything in its way no matter what. I’m not forgetting the terrible shit the CIA has done for decades before 9/11. If anything, 9/11 is likely a response to all the shit the CIA has done for decades before 9/11, but the United States has taken a different approach since these attacks. Congress introduced and passed with flying colors the US Patriot Act that reformed the entire security apparatus in the United States domestic territory. With it, it brought crackdowns on civil rights that the citizens of the US have taken for granted and now were willfully giving it up in the name of national security.

I'm concerned by the fact that US media continues to be complicit normalizing genocide, apartheid, fascism, and everything about the US that it criticizes other countries in doing (read: the non-white countries). US media like *The New York Times*, *AP*, *NPR*, and *The Atlantic* are all describing the actions the US government is doing in a passive voice. Describing abductions as crackdowns.

[^1]: IOF stands for Israel Occupation Forces.
[^2]: Usonian is a term I will be using to refer to “Americans”. If you’ve never heard of it, go read Frank Lloyd Wright’s thoughts when he coined the term.
