El 11 de marzo, Jeffrey Goldberg, el *Editor-in-Chief* de _The Atlantic_ y ex soldado del ejército de la ocupación sionista, was inadvertently added to a [Signal](https://signal.org/)[^2] group chat by a senior Trump administration official that contained several high-profile figures in US government discussing initial plans to what would later be known to the public as the US-led bombing of Yemen on 15 March, [killing 53 people including 2 children and wounding 98 people in total](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/16/houthis-vow-response-as-us-says-unrelenting-strikes-to-continue-in-yemen) as of time of publishing this note. Goldberg in a group chat containing, at least, the Vice President of the United States along with the secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense. Besides the total incompetence showed in opsec[^3] hygiene, the Trump administration’s cabinet showed utter cavalier attitudes towards the people the United States were going to assassinate.

Sorry, did I say assassinate? I forget, the United States does not assassinate people. The United States is one of the most moral countries in the world. They uphold all international laws. No, the United States has a term for when _they_ do the assassinations: *targeted killings*. A noxious euphemism to describe murdering people in a given area of their drone strike.  The United States is saying “we’re not assassinating anyone, folks. We’re the good guys”.

US media is covering this scandal as a failure of national security, a failure from government officials, a failure of the Trump administration. All coming back to the fact that its hypocritical of the Trump administration to have this massive failure using a private company’s service instead of using the sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIFs) these officials are supposed to use to handle classified information when they spent 2016 harkening Hillary Clinton’s private email server.

## Why do I care so much about this?

I'm tired. I'm really fucking tired of living in so many historic moments. I’m not concerned about the fact the federal government used Signal to share classified information inside a group chat. Signalgate is just a distraction from what I consider the real issue at hand.

I'm concerned by the fact that US media continues to be complicit normalizing genocide, apartheid, fascism, and everything about the US that it criticizes other countries in doing (read: the non-white countries). US media like *The New York Times*, *AP*, *NPR*, and *The Atlantic* are all describing the actions the US government is doing in a passive voice. Describing abductions as crackdowns.
